Network Security
NS-1: Establish Network Segmentation Boundaries
Feature	Supported	Enabled By Default	Configuration Responsibility
Virtual Network Integration	True	False	Customer
Network Security Group Support	True	False	Customer
Configuration Guidance:

Virtual Network Integration: Deploy Azure Data Explorer cluster into a subnet in your VNet. Implement NSG rules to restrict traffic and connect on-premises network to the Azure Data Explorer cluster's subnet.
Network Security Group Support: Configure NSG rules when Azure Data Explorer is injected into the customer virtual network. It's recommended to follow a private endpoint-based network security implementation.

NS-2: Secure Cloud Services with Network Controls
Feature	Supported	Enabled By Default	Configuration Responsibility
Azure Private Link	True	False	Customer
Disable Public Network Access	True	False	Customer
Configuration Guidance:

Azure Private Link: Use private endpoints to secure network access to your cluster, which simplifies deployment and reduces maintenance overhead.
Disable Public Network Access: Disable public network access using the service-level IP ACL filtering rule or a toggling switch for public network access.
